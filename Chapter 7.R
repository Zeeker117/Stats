2) Confidence Level, Precision, and Sample Size
	- For a fixed sample size, the higher the confidence level, the wider the resulting
	  confidence interval will be, that is, less precise the estimation will be.
	- We may increase the sample size to obtain both the desired confidence level and
	  the precision of the estimation.
	- The half-width of a confidence interval is called sampling error (or margin of error,
	  or maximum error of estimate) or the bound on the error of estimation
	- If sample mean X¯is used as an estimate of U, we can be 100(1-a)% confident that
	  the error will not exceed... 
						Za/2 a/vn
	- If sample mean X¯is used as an estimate of U, we can be 100(1-a)% confident that
	  the error will not exceed a specific amount SE when the sample size is
						n =
Note:
	1). If s is unknown, we can use the sample standard deviation s
	2). To ensure that the sample size is sufficient to achieve the specified
	    reliability, we should always round the value of n obtained up to the next integer.

example 1
Suppose we wish to estimate the average age of the students at YSU. How
large a sample is necessary if we want to be 95% confident that the sample mean will
be within 1 year of the true mean. From a previous study, the standard deviation of the
ages is known to be 3 years.
						n = ((1.96 * 3)/ 1)^2    ## Z is found from chart ##
						n = 34.57 ~ 35
			We are 95% confident that... 

3) Suppose a 95% confidence interval for the average age of students attending YSU is (22,24). 
   Which of the following statements is correct? (Assume YSU has 13,000 students.)

	a) We can say with 95% confidence that the average age falls between 22 and 24 years.
		TRUE
	b) We are highly confident that 95% of YSU students’ age falls in the interval.
		FALSE
	c) We can say with 95% confidence that the confident interval (22, 24) contains the true
	   population mean.
		TRUE
example in class:

sample 1 <--------------->
	   22              24
sample 2 -<------------->-			## This will be done many times ##
							## Confidence level will cover said % ##
sample 3 -<-------->------	      	## Interval is centered at mean ##	
							
sample 2000...
